# Unbound Combat
Ever wanted more complex combat mechanics in Minecraft? Do you want to provide a more RPG-esque combat experience for your server? If yes, then **Unbound Combat is the plugin for you!** Featuring an impressive overhaul of vanilla Minecraft's combat system, complete with stats, attributes, and even support for skills!

This is a project that was started in 2018, and later became the flagship plugin for the Tyrengard server. We're releasing it as open-source, so everyone can use it. We hope you enjoy!

**WARNING: Unbound Combat overrides Minecraft's vanilla combat system, so it may not play so well with other combat-focused plugins (unless they support this plugin). You have been warned!**

## Features
1. **Combat stats** - 
   Customize everything from melee and ranged damage, health, base resistances, attack and movement speeds, and more! We even introduce a more chance-based critical strike system (no more jump crits!) and evasion!
   
2. **Combat attributes** - 
   We implemented 7 attributes (Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Constitution, Perception, Intellect, and Wisdom) that each give additional combat stats and give players a way to progress and get better in combat.
   
3. **Combat logs** - 
   We store a history of combat for each player, and they can brag about it in global chat! See the details of your most recent battles, including how much damage you dodged, and how many times you hit those sweet 150% damage crits!
   
4. **Party system** - 
   Do you find it lonely adventuring alone, but your friends keep taking the best loot and all the XP? Introducing the party system! You can set BOTH items and XP to be shared across the team! No more salty dungeon raids!
   
5. **Support for combat skills** (with MagicksAPI) - 
   If you install MagicksAPI and a compatible combat skills plugin (or [write one, it's not that hard]()), you can use MagicksAPI's casting system to spice up PvP and PvE. We even have combat stats (mana, mana regen, spell potency, etc.) and combat attributes (Intellect and Wisdom) that specifically augment this.
   
6. **Combat equipment system** (with Unbound Combat Gear) - 
   With Unbound Combat Gear, you can hook into the combat engine and create items with innate combat stats and skills. Create your dream "max evasion" full armor set!
   
7. **Custom mob support** (with Unbound Combat Mobs) - 
   You can create custom mobs with jacked combat stats in Unbound Combat Mobs, give them OP abilities, and watch your players suffer! Or make fair and engaging mobs. Your choice, really.
   
8. **An API for everything we just mentioned** - 
   Want to write your own custom mob plugin and have compatible with Unbound Combat? Or maybe you already have one and are looking to make use of Unbound Combat's overhauled combat engine? Guess what: you can! Unbound Combat fires custom events for the beginning and end of every combat, and for each instance of damage. You can customize each step of the damage calculation to your heart's content! You can even make your own skills plugin or custom items plugin compatible with Unbound Combat. Hooray for open-source!
